User and Permissions Model
==========================

Users can create groups and add/remove other users to/from them.

Assets have an owner and a group, and three different permission sets: owner permissions, group permissions, and anonymous permissions.

Permissions: read (4), update/replace (2), and delete (1)

Permissions on uploaded models are 744 by default.
